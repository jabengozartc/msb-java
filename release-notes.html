   - Added prefetch count for AMQP adapter
     (for details see https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html);
   - Implemented explicit confirm/reject delivered messages;
   - Fixed an issue when `onEnd` callback could be invoked by timeout while not all incoming responses are processed yet;
   - Fixed an issue when time-consuming `onResponse` callbacks could block incoming responses processing;
   - Acceptance testing is enabled by default during a build.

Features of MSB-Java version 1.3.0:
